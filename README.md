# Nitrogen
A discord random nitro code generater that is super fast

# How do I use it?

Generating:
You need python installed
Then just run the generator and it will ask you some questions about how many codes, etc.
When it is done generating (It shows the percent so you will know), you should be able to open the codes.txt file

Checking:
If you want to check it make sure that the codes don't have link begginings, and you have numerous https or http proxies in proxies.txt
Then just run the checker!

# None of these codes work!!!
Of course they don't, this is meant to generate codes for people to run through auto nitro code checkers
