# Nitrogen
A discord random nitro code generater that is super fast

# How do I use it?
Place the generator in a folder with a blank text file called "codes.txt"
You need python installed
Then just run the generator and it will ask you some questions about how many codes, etc.
When it is done generating (It shows the percent so you will know), you should be able to open the codes.txt file

# None of these codes work!!!
Of course they don't, this is meant to generate codes for people to run through auto nitro code checkers
